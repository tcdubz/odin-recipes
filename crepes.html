<h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups milks</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>

<h3><em>Instructions</em></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Sift flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl with an electric
        mixer. Beat in flour mixture until smooth; stir in melted butter.</li>
    <li>Lightly grease a griddle or frying pan; heat over medium-high heat </li>
    <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crêpe. Immediately rotate
        the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the
        bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Shake the pan or loosen with a spatula; turn or flip it over and
        cook until other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
